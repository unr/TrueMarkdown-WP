TrueMarkdown-WP installs a proper Markdown editor, with complete full
screen and vim functionality.

== Description ==

Utilizing Codemirror.net, this plugin aims to provide users with a
proper solution for a complete TinyMCE replacement. This editor is meant
to take your pure markdown, and save that directly to the database.

Typically, editors will parse your entry before saving it. This can lead
to unexpected results. Instead, we save your entry directly to the
database, and convert it to html when you call the_content().

Unlike other wp markdown solutions, this allows you to keep all your
posts in glorious MD.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
